## Morum

This is a very tiny PHP forum built for extremely low-powered environments such as over-sold shared hosting. As long as you have PHP and MySQL you can run this. Inspired by Blake's [1kb_forum](http://www.nerdparadise.com/blogs/blake/6034/) this system corrects many of the gaps to create a forum that <i>actually works</i>.

Some of the main features are:

* Spam protection from [Recaptcha](http://recaptcha.net) and [Akismet](http://akismet.com)
* Basic HTML support (i, b, em, code, blockquote, and pre)
* CSFR, XSS, and SQL Injection tested
* Fully UTF-8
* IP logging
* [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) support
* Auto-Install's in seconds
* No registration required to post!
